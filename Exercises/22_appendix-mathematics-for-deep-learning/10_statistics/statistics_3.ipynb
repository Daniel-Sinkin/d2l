    "#### 3. Run the confidence interval code with $N=2$ and $\\alpha = 0.5$ for $100$ independently generated dataset, and plot the resulting intervals (in this case `t_star = 1.0`).  You will see several very short intervals which are very far from containing the true mean $0$.  Does this contradict the interpretation of the confidence interval?  Do you feel comfortable using short intervals to indicate high precision estimates?"
