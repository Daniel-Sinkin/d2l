    "Yes it is, this is pretty much exactly what it means for the matrix to be rank $1$ (or $0$ if $a = b = c = d$). If $a = 0$ then the matrix can't be rank $2$ and otherwise we can remove the second column by adding $d / a$ times the first colum onto the second. This leaves the determinant unchanged and the new matrix has an empty column."
