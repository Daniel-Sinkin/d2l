    "Note that $9 = \\mu + 4 \\cdot \\sigma$, as such the samples are $4$ standard deviations away from the mean (even worse it's only clustered in one direction). We can determine the likelyhood of this using a $Z$ table. Where we are interested in the complement of a $Z$ value of $4$, which is roughly $1 - 0.99997 = 0.00003 = 0.003\\%$. This is a vanishingly small number so either your random variable is not normally distributed (which given the fact that I've been only been told the standard deviation and the mean is a reasonable assumption) or your measurements are wrong."
