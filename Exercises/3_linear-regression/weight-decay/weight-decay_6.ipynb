    "In Bayesian statistics, the prior distribution $P(w)$ represents the prior belief or knowledge about the parameters $w$ before observing any data. Regularization in machine learning can be interpreted as introducing a particular form of the prior distribution $P(w)$ in the Bayesian formulation. Specifically, the regularization term in the loss function can be seen as the negative log-prior of the parameters, i.e., $-\\log P(w)$. By minimizing the regularized loss function, we are effectively maximizing the posterior distribution $P(w|x) \\propto P(x|w) P(w)$, where $P(x|w)$ is the likelihood function. For example, in the case of L2 regularization (weight decay), the regularization term is proportional to $|w|_2^2$. This corresponds to a Gaussian prior distribution on the weights:\n",
    "$$P(w) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{2} |w|_2^2\\right)$$\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the regularization strength parameter."
