    "#### 3. In the control flow example where we calculate the derivative of `d` with respect to `a`, what would happen if we changed the variable `a` to a random vector or a matrix? At this point, the result of the calculation `f(a)` is no longer a scalar. What happens to the result? How do we analyze this?"
