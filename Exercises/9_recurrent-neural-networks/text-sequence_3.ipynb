    "#### 3. Find some other sources of data (download a standard machine learning dataset, pick another public domain book, scrape a website, etc). For each, tokenize the data at both the word and character levels. How do the vocabulary sizes compare with *The Time Machine* corpus at equivalent values of `min_freq`. Estimate the exponent of the Zipfian distribution corresponding to the unigram and bigram distributions for these corpora. How do they compare with the values that you observed for *The Time Machine* corpus?"
