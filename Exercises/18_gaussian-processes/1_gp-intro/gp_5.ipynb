    "#### 5. Repeat the exercise where we observe a data point at $f(x_1) = 1.2$, but now suppose we additionally observe $f(x_2) = 1.4$. Let $k(x, x_1) = 0.9$, and $k(x, x_2) = 0.8$. Will we be more or less certain about the value of $f(x)$, than when we had only observed $f(x_1)$ÃŸ What is the mean and $95%$ credible set for our value of $f(x)$ now? "
