    "#### 2. Suppose that somebody else possesses a labeled test set $\\mathcal{D}$ and only makes available the unlabeled inputs (features). Now suppose that you can only access the test set labels by running a model $f$ (with no restrictions placed on the model class) on each of the unlabeled inputs and receiving the corresponding error $\\epsilon_\\mathcal{D}(f)$. How many models would you need to evaluate before you leak the entire test set and thus could appear to have error $0$, regardless of your true error?"
