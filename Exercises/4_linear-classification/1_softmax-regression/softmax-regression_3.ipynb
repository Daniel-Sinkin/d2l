    "#### 4. When encoding signals transmitted over a physical wire, engineers do not always use binary codes. For instance, [PAM-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_signal) uses three signal levels $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ as opposed to two levels $\\{0, 1\\}$. How many ternary units do you need to transmit an integer in the range $\\{0, \\ldots, 7\\}$? Why might this be a better idea in terms of electronics?"
